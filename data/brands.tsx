          solution:
            "Check the coolant level and inspect the cooling system for leaks. Ensure that the radiator and water pump are functioning correctly and replace any faulty components. If the engine consistently overheats, have a professional inspect the thermostat and cooling system.",

Upgrade to metal impeller water pumps when possible. Use BMW-approved coolant mixed 50/50 with distilled water. Bleed cooling system properly after any service.",
          prevention:
            "Annual cooling system inspections. Replace coolant every 2 years. Monitor for early warning signs (slow leaks, faint coolant smell). Keep overflow tank at proper level. Consider auxiliary temperature gauge for accurate readings.",

        question: "What is the difference between a turbocharged and a naturally aspirated Dodge engine?",
        answer:
          "A turbocharged engine uses a turbine to force more air into the combustion chamber, increasing power and efficiency without increasing engine size. A naturally aspirated engine relies solely on atmospheric pressure for air intake, offering simpler design and linear power delivery but less power density.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I find the engine code for my Dodge vehicle?",
        answer:
          "The engine code is typically located on a sticker or metal plate in the engine bay, in the owner’s manual, or within the vehicle’s VIN details. You can also find it using online lookup tools by entering your VIN or vehicle registration number.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the best Dodge engines for performance?",
        answer:
          "The 6.2L Supercharged HEMI V8 (Hellcat engine) is widely regarded as the best performance engine from Dodge, delivering 707–807 horsepower. It powers the Challenger and Charger Hellcat models, offering extreme acceleration and track-ready performance.",
      },
      {
        question: "How can I extend the life of my Dodge engine?",
        answer:
          "Extend your Dodge engine’s life by following the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule, using high-quality synthetic oil and OEM-spec parts, addressing warning signs promptly, avoiding aggressive driving when cold, and ensuring the cooling and intake systems are clean and functional.",
